# Solarempi4's Solar System Scale Model
The repository for the Solar System Scale Model on Solarempi4!

## Introduction
This model of the Solar System is based in Minecraft, with a scale of `1 : 4,622,591.362.` It's currently the world's *largest* solar system model.* 
*In terms of the number of objects and possibly size, as well as accuracy. We don't know for sure if anyone has built a larger model.       
**Please** let us know if you have a bigger one and we will compete for the largest and best but we will almost always win ^w^      
ya know, cus of amount of objects :PPPPPPP

## How to use this page
So, this little README has a guide on how to use the other ".md" files.....                                                                       
i think you know where im going with this                                                                                 
*inhale*    

### List of Objects
This file is comprised of multiple files, and all of them list the objects in the model.                                                     
Before you use it, think about what you want to see.

#### How to use the Object Count
The **Object Count** is the first file you should go to in the files [Count](count.md).
To use:           
1. Use the table to find the type of object that you wish to find the number of.
That's literally it. Not sure why you would need this.      
There is also a link to the specified list of objects.

#### How to use the Object List
Ah, here we go. The main part of the files are the **Object Lists**, large lists of all the objects in the solar system scale model. This can be
used to see if a certain object has been added to the model, and the update it was added in.        
To use:       
1. Find the desired object category from the Model List. In this example, we will find the moon Ganymede.
2. Click on the link that goes to the list of the specified type of object. So, we will click the [MOON LIST](listmoons.md).
3. Go through the chapter viewer and select the object from a category. Since Ganymede is from Jupiter, it will be found in the list of Jupiter's moons.
4. Have fun with these statistics!

Here are the guidelines on what objects can be submitted and what to put on the form:
