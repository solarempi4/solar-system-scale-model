# Solarempi4's Solar System Scale Model
The repository for the Solar System Scale Model on Solarempi4!

## Introduction
This model of the Solar System is based in Minecraft, with a scale of `1 : 4,622,591.362.` It's currently the world's *largest* solar system model.* 
*In terms of the number of objects and possibly size, as well as accuracy. We don't know for sure if anyone has built a larger model.       
**Please** let us know if you have a bigger one and we will compete for the largest and best but we will almost always win ^w^      
ya know, cus of amount of objects :PPPPPPP

## How to use this page
So, this little README has a guide on how to use the other ".md" files.....                                                                       
i think you know where im going with this                                                                                 
*inhale*    

### List of Objects
This file is comprised of multiple files, and all of them list the objects in the model.                                                     
Before you use it, think about what you want to see.

#### How to use the Object Count
The **Object Count** is the first file you should go to in the files [Count](count.md).
To use:           
1. Use the table to find the type of object that you wish to find the number of.
That's literally it. Not sure why you would need this.      
There is also a link to the specified list of objects.

#### How to use the Object List
Ah, here we go. The main part of the files are the **Object Lists**, large lists of all the objects in the solar system scale model. This can be
used to see if a certain object has been added to the model, and the update it was added in.        
To use:       
1. Find the desired object category from the Model List. In this example, we will find the moon Ganymede.
2. Click on the link that goes to the list of the specified type of object. So, we will click the [MOON LIST](listmoons.md).
3. Go through the chapter viewer and select the object from a category. Since Ganymede is from Jupiter, it will be found in the list of Jupiter's moons.
4. Have fun with these statistics!

### [Changelog](changelog.md) and Updates
This page is the changelog for the solar system scale model's progress. In it, we will address what has been added or removed or changed in the latest update of the 
Solar System Scale Model.

#### How to use the [Changelog](changelog.md)
1. Go to the update in the .md file in the chapters.
2. **R e a d .**

### [Credits](credits.md) Page
The credits page is pretty straightforward, it explains the contributions of people that have requested models or have directly helped.
1. just read the text :P

## Submit a model!
You can also help contribute to the model with a form on our website at https://solarempi4.solarorbit.net/      
Simply fill out the form and submit it to us, and we will DM you on Discord about the status of the item and whether or not it will be added to the next update.       
Here are the guidelines on what objects can be submitted and what to put on the form:      
1. **Stay on topic.** We don't like when people send random things through this form, it is specifically for submitting an object to the Solarempi4 Solar System Scale Model.
2. **All chat rules on Solarempi4 apply.** You can see the full list of rules on our Discord: https://discord.gg/CEnFMaGEXt. Anything that breaks our rules will be disregarded and the person who submitted the form will be shortly punished.

## Units of Measurement
These units of measurement were used heavily while making both the world download and the server's model.     
1. **Scale Model Constant** **$S_f$** The constant multiplied by the scale distance in km to get the scaled size. Defined as $\frac{301}{1391400}$ which is about `0.000216328`. It is also known as the scaled size of 1 km in the model, expressed in meters.
2. **Scale AU** **$S_{AU}$** The constant obtained by mulitplying the **Scale Model Constant** **$S_f$** by `149597870.7`, the distance between Earth and the Sun in real life, or 1 **astronomical unit**. Defined as $S_f(149597870.7 km)$ which is about `32,362.339`. It is also known as the scaled size of an AU in the model expressed in meters.
3. **Particle Unit** **$\frac{S_f}{8}$**. The constant obtained by dividing the scaled size of a model by 8. Used in making the PARTICLE MOONS OF THE SERVER MODEL. Defined as **$\frac{S_s - \frac{P_s}{2}}{8}$** where $P_s$ is the size of the particle used for the object. Does not need to be added if the particle size is less than 0.001.
4. **Armor Stand Height With Player Head with Outer Layer** **$2.06605 m$** The constant obtained by measuring the height from the bottom of an armor stand to the highest point on the outer layer of the player head it wears and defining the size in m, which is 2.06605 m.
5. **Height of Player Head with Outer Layer on an Armor Stand** **$0.655 m$** The constant obtained by measuring the exact height of the player head with an outer layer on an armor stand. This size is defined as 0.655 m.
6. **Distance from the Bottom of an armor stand to the Center of any headgear** **$1.7383 m$** The constant obtained by subtracting the size of a player head with outer layer on an armor stand from the height of an armor stand with a player head on top: $2.06605 - 0.655 = 1.7383$.
