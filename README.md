# Solarempi4's Solar System Scale Model
The repository for the Solar System Scale Model on Solarempi4!

## Introduction
This model of the Solar System is based in Minecraft, with a scale of `1 : 4,622,591.362.` It's currently the world's *largest* solar system model.* 
*In terms of the number of objects and possibly size, as well as accuracy. We don't know for sure if anyone has built a larger model.       
**Please** let us know if you have a bigger one and we will compete for the largest and best but we will almost always win ^w^      
ya know, cus of amount of objects :PPPPPPP

### List of Objects [LIST.MD](LIST.md)
This file is a list of objects in the Solar System model.                                                           
Before you use it, think about what you want to see.

#### How to use the Object Count
The **Object Count** is the first section in the file [LIST.MD](LIST.md).
To use:           
1. Use the table to find the type of object that you wish to find the number of.
That's literally it. Not sure why you would need this.

#### How to use the Object List
Ah, here we go. The main part of the file is the **Object List**, a large list of all the objects in the solar system scale model. This can be
used to see if a certain object has been added to the model.        
To use:       
1. Find the desired object category from the Model List. In this example, we will find the moon Ganymede.
2.
